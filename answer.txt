jQuery function, which lets you select elements using CSS selectors, when you pass a selector to a jquery function it returns a jquery object.

The jQuery object has properties like length and methods on it like ready(), click() etc. The jQuery object just wraps the DOM elements to make interactivity and DOM manipulation easier.
